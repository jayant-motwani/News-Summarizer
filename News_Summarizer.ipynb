            "This live blog has now closed, please visit here for our latest coverageAn adviser to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack on the country’s independence day tomorrow.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday.Rodnyansky said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}People are reacting to the news. They are trying to ensure they have contingency plans, they don’t want to spend too much time near the centre near the buildings of our government.He added:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}There is a risk Russia will try to strike exactly at that time to compensate for their inability to have any success on the battlefield, to have any success in subduing Ukraine and basically all the failures they have run up over the last six months.Rodnyansky’s comments came after the US warned Russia may “step up” efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days.Ukraine’s defence ministry has advised Ukrainians to be especially careful on independence day, citing the threat of missile attacks and “provocations” from Russia.Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email.It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand:The US is expected to announce an additional military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), according to reports. The new package will be announced on Wednesday, the day the war in Ukraine hits the six-month mark, US officials were cited as saying. It would be the largest such assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war.Many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack on the country’s independence day, according to an adviser to Ukraine’s president. Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday.The US has issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. The warning is the first specific security alert the US embassy in Kyiv has issued in recent months and comes after a ban by the Ukrainian government on celebrations in the capital to mark Wednesday’s anniversary of independence from Soviet rule because of fears of attack.The head of Ukraine’s security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said he expects Russia’s security services to stage a series of terrorist attacks in Russian cities, resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties. Danilov said that the murder on Saturday of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was the first in what he expects to be a number of attacks.Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed a “powerful response” in the event of a Russian attack on Kyiv on or around independence day on Wednesday. There was a daily threat of Russian attacks and Ukrainian intelligence was working with foreign intelligence, Zelenskiy said in a joint news conference with the visiting Polish president, Andrzej Duda.Ukraine’s president said the country will not agree to any proposal to freeze the current frontlines in its conflict with Russia in order to “calm” Moscow, which now controls about 22% of Ukraine including Crimea. Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv today, Zelenskiy urged the world not to show fatigue with the war, saying this would pose a big threat to the whole world.Zelenskiy also promised to bring “freedom to Ukraine and citizens in Crimea” and vowed that the Ukrainian flag will fly “where it’s supposed to be” in all occupied parts of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said Kyiv would restore Ukrainian rule over the Russia-annexed region. “It started in Crimea and it will end in Crimea,” he told an international conference on Crimea.Boris Johnson has urged world leaders not to allow Vladimir Putin to repeat the annexation of Crimea in other parts of Ukraine. Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform summit.Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina, the daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist ideologues. Dugina, daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was murdered on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside Moscow. Russia’s FSB security service has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of ordering her killing, which Kyiv denies.Russian tourists may be banned from entering Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland if the EU does not enact a bloc-wide ban, according to Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. Russians should not be allowed to enter the EU while their country “is undertaking genocide”, Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius. It comes after the US rebuffed Ukraine’s demand for a blanket visa ban on Russians.The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling”, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues.The war in Ukraine has pushed people to “a critical breaking point” with “devastating” knock-on effects that will only grow as the conflict drags on, the Red Cross has warned. Soaring inflation and shortages of essential products like fuel and food in Ukraine and neighbouring countries have left people struggling to afford basic supplies, with the situation becoming more desperate as the weather chills in the weeks ahead. Kyiv has accused Moscow of having organised illegal mass adoptions of Ukrainian children after transferring them from occupied territories to Russia. “More than 1,000 children from Mariupol,” were “illegally transferred to outsiders in Tyumen, Irkutsk, Kemerovo and Altai Krai” in Siberia, a statement by Ukraine’s foreign ministry read.The UN has said it is “very concerned” about plans by Russian-backed authorities to hold trials for captured Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol. Pro-Russian officials appear to be installing metal cages in a hall in Mariupol as part of plans to establish what they were calling an “international tribunal”, a UN rights office spokesperson said, adding that such a process could itself amount to a war crime.That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thanks for reading. Here’s some more detail on the US military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn, which would be the single largest assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war.The package will use funds from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, appropriated by the US congress, to allow the Biden administration to procure weapons from industry rather than taking weapons from existing US weapons stocks, Reuters reports.The new weapons do not appear to include types of arms that had not been provided previously to the Ukrainian military, according to a US official.The amount and mix of weapons could change before the formal announcement, expected to take place tomorrow, the official added.Kyiv has accused Moscow of having organised illegal mass adoptions of Ukrainian children after transferring them from occupied territories to Russia.Since the beginning of the war, Kyiv has been accusing Moscow of “deporting” Ukrainians, saying Ukrainians from occupied territories have been forced to go to Russia rather than other regions of Ukraine.Ukraine’s foreign ministry said in a statement:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The Russian Federation continues to abduct children from the territory of Ukraine and arrange their illegal adoption by Russian citizens.“More than 1,000 children from Mariupol,” a southern Ukrainian city occupied by Russian troops, “were illegally transferred to outsiders in Tyumen, Irkutsk, Kemerovo and Altai Krai” in Siberia, the statement read.Read the full story here.The US is expected to announce an additional military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), according to reports.Associated Press cites US officials as saying that the new package will be announced on Wednesday, the day the war in Ukraine hits the six-month mark.The $3bn weapons assistance package would be the largest such assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war.The money will be used to train and equip Ukrainian forces to fight for years to come, as well as fund contracts for drones, weapons and other equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two, the sources said.Unlike most previous aid packages, the new funding will be aimed at helping Ukraine secure its future defence needs, according to officials familiar with the matter. Earlier packages focused on Ukraine’s more immediate needs for weapons and ammunition. The new package is intended to reassure Ukrainian officials that the US is committed to maintaining its support, regardless of the day-to-day back and forth of the conflict, the officials said.The war in Ukraine has pushed people to “a critical breaking point” with “devastating” knock-on effects that will only grow as the conflict drags on, the Red Cross has warned.The organisation said that “even if the conflict were to end tomorrow, it will take years to repair the damage to cities and homes and the impact on families”, AFP reports.Soaring inflation and shortages of essential products like fuel and food in Ukraine and neighbouring countries have left people struggling to afford basic supplies, with the situation becoming more desperate as the weather chills in the weeks ahead.Maksym Dotsenko, head of the Ukrainian Red Cross, said in a virtual press briefing:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}It will be the hardest winter. The war, now six months old, has stretched the entire humanitarian system and could lead to lasting impacts on the ability of organisations to tackle emergencies worldwide, the Red Cross added.Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine will not agree to any proposal to freeze the current frontlines in its conflict with Russia in order to “calm” Moscow, which now controls about 22% of Ukraine including Crimea.Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv today, the Ukrainian president urged the world not to show fatigue with the war, saying this would pose a big threat to the whole world.Zelenskiy told reporters:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}We’ll get back Crimea by any means we deem right, without consulting other countries.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said Vladimir Putin is betting the bloc’s response to his invasion of Ukraine will fracture as soaring prices hit European voters’ wallets.Russia’s president sees “the weariness of the Europeans and the reluctance of their citizens to bear the consequences of support for Ukraine”, Borrell said in an interview with AFP.“We will have to endure, spread the costs within the EU,” Borrell said. He added:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}We must give Ukraine support that goes beyond supplying weapons. Faced with someone who refuses to stop the war, we must be able to resist.Keeping the 27 member states united was a task to be carried out “day by day”, Borrell told the news agency. He also said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The member states are masters of their foreign policy. We must ensure that their interests reach a common point. We are always in compromise mode.Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said the country expects to receive up to $16bn (£13.5bn) of financial support from its international partners by the end of this year to help it deal with Russia’s invasion.In a statement, Shmyhal said Ukraine had managed to maintain its financial stability thanks to external assistance, which had already accounted for $14bn.More than 40% of the Ukrainian government’s spending so far this year – more than $11.5bn (£9.7bn) – had been allocated to military needs, he added.Hundreds of people have lined up in Moscow to pay tributes to Darya Dugina, the murdered daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist thinkers, hailing her as a martyr whose death must be avenged with victory in the war in Ukraine.Dugina, the daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was killed on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside the capital. Moscow has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of masterminding her killing, a claim Kyiv has denied.Her father, Dugin, 60, who for decades pushed for the creation of a new Russian state that would annex the territory of countries including Ukraine, told mourners his daughter “died for the people, died for Russia”.“The huge price we have to pay can only be justified by the highest achievement, our victory,” a visibly emotional Dugin said..css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}She lived for the sake of victory, and she died for the sake of victory. Our Russian victory, our truth, our Orthodox faith, our state.A large black and white portrait of Dugina, 30, who was reportedly close to her father and worked as a nationalist media commentator, hung on a wall behind her coffin.Read the full story by my colleague Pjotr Sauer here.It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand:Many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack on the country’s independence day, according to an adviser to Ukraine’s president. Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday.The US has issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. The warning is the first specific security alert the US embassy in Kyiv has issued in recent months and comes after a ban by the Ukrainian government on celebrations in the capital to mark Wednesday’s anniversary of independence from Soviet rule because of fears of attack.The mayor of Dnipro, Borys Filatov, has said  Russian rockets are falling on homes in the city and urged residents to stay under cover. Dnipro is located in south-central Ukraine and has been subjected to Russian long-range missile attacks during the war.The head of Ukraine’s security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said he expects Russia’s security services to stage a series of terrorist attacks in Russian cities, resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties. Danilov said that the murder on Saturday of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was the first in what he expects to be a number of attacks.Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina, the  daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist ideologues.

Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform summit.Russian forces are likely to have started to move barges to construct a floating bridge over the Dnipro River near the Antonivsky bridge, a British intelligence update said. The bridge in Kherson has been targeted repeatedly by Ukrainian forces with missile strikes as it is a key supply route for Russia in the south of the country. If Russia completes the improvised bridge, it will almost certainly increase the capacity of the crossing point compared with the ferry, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) believes.Russian tourists may be banned from entering Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland if the EU does not enact a bloc-wide ban, according to Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. Russians should not be allowed to enter the EU while their country “is undertaking genocide”, Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius.

The sanctioned individuals include high-ranking Russian government officials, their family members, and senior officials of currently sanctioned defence sector entities, a statement by the Canadian government said.A total of 33 cargo ships carrying around 719,549 tonnes of foodstuffs have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said. A further 18 vessels were loading or waiting for permission to leave Ukrainian ports, the ministry added. Three Black Sea ports were unblocked under the deal signed on 22 July by Moscow and Kyiv.Monthly payments to UK hosts of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them to provide housing for more than six months amid the cost of living crisis, the minister responsible has said. Councils have warned that homelessness could rise if refugees’ initial six-month placements with hosts end without alternative options in place.Good afternoon from London. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you with all the latest from Ukraine. I’m on Twitter or you can email me.Boris Johnson has urged world leaders not to allow Vladimir Putin to repeat the annexation of Crimea in other parts of Ukraine.Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform summit.\r\n",
            "\tPrime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled plans to create a special team focused on countering Russian disinformation and propaganda on Tuesday, as Ukrainians prepared to mark the six-month anniversary of Moscow's invasion of their country.\r\n",
            "\tThe prime minister announced the new initiative as part of a package of new Canadian measures designed to support Ukraine and punish Russia for launching a war that has killed tens of thousands and whose impacts are being felt around the world.\r\n",
            "\tCanada is also imposing sanctions against 62 more people, including those the government described as several Russian regional governors and their families, as well as a Russian company whose products include anti-drone equipment.\r\n",
            "\tOttawa is also planning to spend nearly $4 million on two projects to bolster Ukraine's military and police services, including training to help Ukrainian police officers better handle cases involving sexual trauma as well as mental-health programs.\r\n",
            "\tTrudeau revealed the package during a special meeting of leaders from countries that have been supporting Ukraine since Russian forces first crossed into the country on Feb. 24, launching Europe's largest conflict since the Second World War.\r\n",

Will this conflict ever end?UKRANIAN REFUGEES IN THE US:Long-term survival is a big concern. Here's why.The U.S. is sending Ukraine a very expensive package for its independence day: $3 billion more in security aid.The latest assistance, to be announced Wednesday as Ukraine celebrates its separation from the Soviet Union in 1991, will focus less on the current war with Russia and more on equipping and training Ukrainian forces for the long term, U.S. officials told the Associated Press. The money will fund contracts for drones, weapons and other equipment that may not see the battlefield for a year or two, they said on condition of anonymity.The new package, unveiled as the war reaches the six-month mark, also serves as proof the United States remains committed to supporting Ukraine through thick and thin in the conflict, the officials said.The Ukrainian pro soccer league kicked off its new season Tuesday after a poignant ceremony paying tribute to those fighting in the war with Russia.

Get features likeA day after the Indian Air Force (IAF) successfully targeted the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror training camp at Balakot on February 26, 2019, to avenge the Pulwama terror strike, the Pakistanis launched a counter with US F-16 fighters and Chinese JF-17 fighters south of Pir Panjal in Jammu and Kashmir. There is documentary evidence that the Pakistan Air Force relied only on F-16s to target unspecified targets in the Nowshera-Rajouri-Poonch sector across the LoC with JF-17 fighters not involved in the action at all. The Pakistani strike was intercepted by Indian fighters with Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman shooting down a much superior F-16 before crashing his vintage MiG-21 Bison in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). While the US F-16 fired air-to-air missiles at Indian fighters, the much-touted Sino-Pak developed JF-17 was just for show and did not see the air battle and remained hidden behind the American fighters. The JF-17 programme today is in the doldrums due to a lack of spare parts for the Russian-made Klimov RD 93 aircraft engine.Stung by multiple failures of JF-17 aircraft, primarily due to the serviceability of RD-93 engines, Pakistan had directly approached Russia for procuring the RD-93 engines, bypassing China. In the aftermath of multiple negotiations by Islamabad with Moscow, Russian engine company Kilmov has now indicated its willingness to supply RD-93 engines and its associated repair systems and maintenance facilities to JF-17 aircraft. However, in 2018, M/s Rosoboronexport, which is authorised to export defence equipment including RD- 93 engines and spares, was sanctioned by the US, thereby adversely affecting the sourcing of RD-93 engine spares by the PAF. The sanctions restrict Rosoboronexport from undertaking US dollar transactions, which the two governments and the concerned banks have now been attempting to sort out.Russia has been strengthening its defence ties with Pakistan by allowing it to procure the RD-93 engine directly from it as opposed to using China as an intermediary as was the case previously. However, international relations are in a state of flux and strategic equations are changing fast with Russia coming under pressure from the West and looking for support from others. It is apparent that Russia is moving close to China in the evolving geo­ political matrix which is sought to be exploited by Pakistan.Pakistan Air Force saddled with underperforming JF-17 aircraftThe JF-17 fighter jets, developed jointly by Pakistan and China, which was supposed to be a low-cost, lightweight, all-weather, multi-role fighter with a Chinese airframe, has now become a liability for Islamabad as it failed to keep up with the hype of being the best fighter aircraft in the world. Islamabad's experience with the JF-17 aircraft, particularly its Russian-made RD-93 engines, tells a completely different story besides casting serious doubt on the quality of these aircraft. The Pakistan military leadership had expected a fighter aircraft, something akin to the Russian Su-30 MKI or the French Mirage 2000 but the JF-17 aircraft fell well short of their high hopes as the aircraft performed poorly against the Indian Air Force's Mirage 2000 and Su-30s.Incidentally, since its induction into the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) in 2009, the JF-17 recorded a string of crashes, casting serious doubts on the fitness of the aircraft as the PAF found much to its chagrin, that the JF-17 aircraft is nowhere near the boastful claims made by China due to problems encountered in the performance of Russian made RD-93 engines, installed in the aircraft.Compounding the problem, the PAF has been encountering challenges in the serviceability of the aircraft due to a shortage of spares and engines. A large number of Russian RD 93 engines, installed in the JF-17 aircraft have developed cracks in guide vanes, exhaust nozzles and flame stabilisers, and the PAF has been struggling hard to replace these engines due to contractual obligations which forces Pakistan to procure the RD-93 engines from Russia only through China. Adding to the woes of the PAF, the China National Aero­ Technology Export & Import Corporation's (CATIC) tepid response in providing necessary spares and support for the RD-93 engines of PAF's JF-17 aircraft led to the grounding of more than half of the total number of these aircraft (137) held by the PAF.\n",

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later.Every week, I look at a map of Ukraine showing areas now controlled by Russia. There are roads and towns in the eastern Donbas region where I was able to freely walk and drive around two months ago that are now under Russian occupation.It’s the easiest way to confirm that Ukraine is losing the war.You may read regularly about some new shipment of weapons which will help Ukraine turn the tide in the east, or mount a major counter-offensive in the south. But it hasn’t happened yet.Sometimes it feels like the West is giving Ukraine just enough weaponry to hang on, rather than to win, even if it has made some interesting recent moves in striking at Russia’s naval bases in Crimea.It is true that Russian troops have made no significant territorial gains since they took the eastern city of Lysychansk on July 2, two weeks after I was in the city.But Russia did order a two-week operational pause to solidify its gains after taking Lysychansk, and it has now mounted a withering assault on the nearby city of Siversk.People sit inside a subway car parked in a station being used as a bomb shelter, as Russian attacks continue in Kharkiv, Ukraine.Credit:APSince President Vladimir Putin gave up his goal of taking the capital, Kyiv, and changed his strategy to capturing all of the Donbas and consolidating his gains in the south, Russia has been winning in what is a long, grinding conflict. That is the brutal truth of the matter.This probably hasn’t sunk in for many Australians. Because it was roughly at the time when Putin started shifting his strategy that interest in the war dropped off.After spending six weeks of this year in Ukraine, much of it in or near front-line positions in the east, my only prediction is this: the war has a long way to go yet. This is because both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are many more anniversaries away from achieving their goals.Putin’s goal is to take all of the Donbas, and then maybe mount another strike at Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv. While now controlling more than 20 per cent of Ukraine, he is many months away from achieving that.Ukrainian firefighters work in destroyed buildings after a rocket attack in Kharkiv on August 19.Credit:APAnd Zelensky’s objective is to push Russian soldiers out of all areas Ukraine controlled prior to Russia’s invasion on February 24. Zelensky’s goal, while inherently understandable, is even more unachievable than Putin’s as it currently stands.So we are left with an almost stalemate in which Putin advances centimetre by centimetre in the east and Ukraine tries to mount a counter-offensive in the south to take back the key port city of Kherson.So how will this end?Peace, if we can call it that, will probably look something like this: Ukraine gives up everything it didn’t control before February 24 this year, and Russia withdraws from everywhere else. That means recognising Russia’s annexation of Crimea and handing over the two breakaway regions of the Donbas to Moscow-backed separatists.But neither side is close to viewing this outcome as a win. Putin wouldn’t even consider it at the moment because he controls a lot more than that now, so he might as well keep going.And Zelensky doesn’t because he wouldn’t have ever countenanced it before February 24, and therefore the war would be all for nothing. Most importantly, Ukrainians wouldn’t accept that outcome; they would view it as a humiliation.It can’t be overstated how unfair this settlement would be for Ukrainians.Neither can it be overstated how dreadful it will be for them if the country continues to lose ground to Russia.But we will probably get to that outcome – or some rough version of it – after a lot more fighting and deaths.Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

My daughter has sacrificed her young life on the altar of victory. So please win!\"Russia's FSB security service said the attack was carried out by a Ukrainian woman born in 1979, whom it named and whose picture and information appeared on Russian news websites.They linked her to Ukraine's security services and accused her of being a member of the Azov battalion, a unit of Ukraine's army that Russia has designated a terrorist group.In response, Azov said the woman had never been a member of the unit and accused Russia of concocting a lie.The FSB said the woman had arrived in Russia in July and spent a month preparing the attack. She had fled to Estonia afterwards, it said.Russian law enforcement agencies had placed the woman on the country's wanted list, TASS news agency reported, with Moscow seeking her extradition.Estonia's interior ministry and police and border guard service said in separate statements they could share information on individuals entering and leaving Estonia \"only in cases prescribed by law\", adding the FSB allegation did not meet that requirement.Flowers and candles are placed next to a portrait of media commentator Darya Dugina, who was killed in a car bomb attack, in Moscow, Russia August 22, 2022. REUTERS/Maxim ShemetovPutin paid tribute to Dugina as a patriot, calling her murder \"evil and cruel\", while Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the Kremlin-backed RT media organisation, suggested agents could track the woman down.\"Estonia, of course will not hand them over,\" Simonyan wrote on Telegram.A memorial service for Dugina will be held on Tuesday at Moscow's TV centre, her father said.On Monday, residents of Moscow laid flowers and lit candles at a makeshift memorial.\"She was a unique person, and this loss is absolutely irreplaceable,\" said Sergei Sidorov.Some Russian opposition figures were sceptical about the speed at which the FSB appeared to have solved the case and suggested alternative versions.Ilya Ponomaryov, a former lawmaker turned Ukraine-based Kremlin critic, said a previously unknown group of Russian militants called the National Republican Army was responsible.His assertion and the group's existence could not be independently verified by Reuters.Russia's Investigative Committee did not respond to a request for comment.Ponomaryov was the only member of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, to vote against the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and later left Russia.Ponomaryov, who runs an online TV station designed to challenge the Kremlin's narrative of the war, read out a manifesto he said the group had sent him.It said the group was committed to overthrowing Putin and building a new Russia. Such statements are illegal inside Russia and those who make them face long jail terms.His assertion adds to a list of possible theories about who killed Dugina.Some people believe her father was the target.Ukraine's Podolyak said he believed the killing was the result of a struggle between Russia's intelligence services.Some Russian opposition activists have speculated the murder may have been orchestrated by forces inside Russia keen to discourage ultra-nationalists like Dugin from criticising the Kremlin for being, in their eyes, too soft on Ukraine.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed on Tuesday to restore Ukrainian rule over Russia-annexed Crimea, a move that he said would help re-establish \"world law and order\".Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

            "This live blog has now closed, please visit here for our latest coverageAn adviser to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack on the country’s independence day tomorrow.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday.Rodnyansky said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}People are reacting to the news. They are trying to ensure they have contingency plans, they don’t want to spend too much time near the centre near the buildings of our government.He added:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}There is a risk Russia will try to strike exactly at that time to compensate for their inability to have any success on the battlefield, to have any success in subduing Ukraine and basically all the failures they have run up over the last six months.Rodnyansky’s comments came after the US warned Russia may “step up” efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days.Ukraine’s defence ministry has advised Ukrainians to be especially careful on independence day, citing the threat of missile attacks and “provocations” from Russia.Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email.It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand:The US is expected to announce an additional military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), according to reports. The new package will be announced on Wednesday, the day the war in Ukraine hits the six-month mark, US officials were cited as saying. It would be the largest such assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war.Many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack on the country’s independence day, according to an adviser to Ukraine’s president. Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday.The US has issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. The warning is the first specific security alert the US embassy in Kyiv has issued in recent months and comes after a ban by the Ukrainian government on celebrations in the capital to mark Wednesday’s anniversary of independence from Soviet rule because of fears of attack.The head of Ukraine’s security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said he expects Russia’s security services to stage a series of terrorist attacks in Russian cities, resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties. Danilov said that the murder on Saturday of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was the first in what he expects to be a number of attacks.Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed a “powerful response” in the event of a Russian attack on Kyiv on or around independence day on Wednesday. There was a daily threat of Russian attacks and Ukrainian intelligence was working with foreign intelligence, Zelenskiy said in a joint news conference with the visiting Polish president, Andrzej Duda.Ukraine’s president said the country will not agree to any proposal to freeze the current frontlines in its conflict with Russia in order to “calm” Moscow, which now controls about 22% of Ukraine including Crimea. Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv today, Zelenskiy urged the world not to show fatigue with the war, saying this would pose a big threat to the whole world.Zelenskiy also promised to bring “freedom to Ukraine and citizens in Crimea” and vowed that the Ukrainian flag will fly “where it’s supposed to be” in all occupied parts of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said Kyiv would restore Ukrainian rule over the Russia-annexed region. “It started in Crimea and it will end in Crimea,” he told an international conference on Crimea.Boris Johnson has urged world leaders not to allow Vladimir Putin to repeat the annexation of Crimea in other parts of Ukraine. Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform summit.Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina, the daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist ideologues. Dugina, daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was murdered on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside Moscow. Russia’s FSB security service has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of ordering her killing, which Kyiv denies.Russian tourists may be banned from entering Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland if the EU does not enact a bloc-wide ban, according to Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. Russians should not be allowed to enter the EU while their country “is undertaking genocide”, Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius. It comes after the US rebuffed Ukraine’s demand for a blanket visa ban on Russians.The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling”, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues.The war in Ukraine has pushed people to “a critical breaking point” with “devastating” knock-on effects that will only grow as the conflict drags on, the Red Cross has warned. Soaring inflation and shortages of essential products like fuel and food in Ukraine and neighbouring countries have left people struggling to afford basic supplies, with the situation becoming more desperate as the weather chills in the weeks ahead. Kyiv has accused Moscow of having organised illegal mass adoptions of Ukrainian children after transferring them from occupied territories to Russia. “More than 1,000 children from Mariupol,” were “illegally transferred to outsiders in Tyumen, Irkutsk, Kemerovo and Altai Krai” in Siberia, a statement by Ukraine’s foreign ministry read.The UN has said it is “very concerned” about plans by Russian-backed authorities to hold trials for captured Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol. Pro-Russian officials appear to be installing metal cages in a hall in Mariupol as part of plans to establish what they were calling an “international tribunal”, a UN rights office spokesperson said, adding that such a process could itself amount to a war crime.That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thanks for reading. Here’s some more detail on the US military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn, which would be the single largest assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war.The package will use funds from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, appropriated by the US congress, to allow the Biden administration to procure weapons from industry rather than taking weapons from existing US weapons stocks, Reuters reports.The new weapons do not appear to include types of arms that had not been provided previously to the Ukrainian military, according to a US official.The amount and mix of weapons could change before the formal announcement, expected to take place tomorrow, the official added.Kyiv has accused Moscow of having organised illegal mass adoptions of Ukrainian children after transferring them from occupied territories to Russia.Since the beginning of the war, Kyiv has been accusing Moscow of “deporting” Ukrainians, saying Ukrainians from occupied territories have been forced to go to Russia rather than other regions of Ukraine.Ukraine’s foreign ministry said in a statement:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The Russian Federation continues to abduct children from the territory of Ukraine and arrange their illegal adoption by Russian citizens.“More than 1,000 children from Mariupol,” a southern Ukrainian city occupied by Russian troops, “were illegally transferred to outsiders in Tyumen, Irkutsk, Kemerovo and Altai Krai” in Siberia, the statement read.Read the full story here.The US is expected to announce an additional military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), according to reports.Associated Press cites US officials as saying that the new package will be announced on Wednesday, the day the war in Ukraine hits the six-month mark.The $3bn weapons assistance package would be the largest such assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war.The money will be used to train and equip Ukrainian forces to fight for years to come, as well as fund contracts for drones, weapons and other equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two, the sources said.Unlike most previous aid packages, the new funding will be aimed at helping Ukraine secure its future defence needs, according to officials familiar with the matter. Earlier packages focused on Ukraine’s more immediate needs for weapons and ammunition. The new package is intended to reassure Ukrainian officials that the US is committed to maintaining its support, regardless of the day-to-day back and forth of the conflict, the officials said.The war in Ukraine has pushed people to “a critical breaking point” with “devastating” knock-on effects that will only grow as the conflict drags on, the Red Cross has warned.The organisation said that “even if the conflict were to end tomorrow, it will take years to repair the damage to cities and homes and the impact on families”, AFP reports.Soaring inflation and shortages of essential products like fuel and food in Ukraine and neighbouring countries have left people struggling to afford basic supplies, with the situation becoming more desperate as the weather chills in the weeks ahead.Maksym Dotsenko, head of the Ukrainian Red Cross, said in a virtual press briefing:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}It will be the hardest winter. The war, now six months old, has stretched the entire humanitarian system and could lead to lasting impacts on the ability of organisations to tackle emergencies worldwide, the Red Cross added.Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine will not agree to any proposal to freeze the current frontlines in its conflict with Russia in order to “calm” Moscow, which now controls about 22% of Ukraine including Crimea.Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv today, the Ukrainian president urged the world not to show fatigue with the war, saying this would pose a big threat to the whole world.Zelenskiy told reporters:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}We’ll get back Crimea by any means we deem right, without consulting other countries.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said Vladimir Putin is betting the bloc’s response to his invasion of Ukraine will fracture as soaring prices hit European voters’ wallets.Russia’s president sees “the weariness of the Europeans and the reluctance of their citizens to bear the consequences of support for Ukraine”, Borrell said in an interview with AFP.“We will have to endure, spread the costs within the EU,” Borrell said. He added:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}We must give Ukraine support that goes beyond supplying weapons. Faced with someone who refuses to stop the war, we must be able to resist.Keeping the 27 member states united was a task to be carried out “day by day”, Borrell told the news agency. He also said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The member states are masters of their foreign policy. We must ensure that their interests reach a common point. We are always in compromise mode.Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said the country expects to receive up to $16bn (£13.5bn) of financial support from its international partners by the end of this year to help it deal with Russia’s invasion.In a statement, Shmyhal said Ukraine had managed to maintain its financial stability thanks to external assistance, which had already accounted for $14bn.More than 40% of the Ukrainian government’s spending so far this year – more than $11.5bn (£9.7bn) – had been allocated to military needs, he added.Hundreds of people have lined up in Moscow to pay tributes to Darya Dugina, the murdered daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist thinkers, hailing her as a martyr whose death must be avenged with victory in the war in Ukraine.Dugina, the daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was killed on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside the capital. Moscow has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of masterminding her killing, a claim Kyiv has denied.Her father, Dugin, 60, who for decades pushed for the creation of a new Russian state that would annex the territory of countries including Ukraine, told mourners his daughter “died for the people, died for Russia”.“The huge price we have to pay can only be justified by the highest achievement, our victory,” a visibly emotional Dugin said..css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}She lived for the sake of victory, and she died for the sake of victory. Our Russian victory, our truth, our Orthodox faith, our state.A large black and white portrait of Dugina, 30, who was reportedly close to her father and worked as a nationalist media commentator, hung on a wall behind her coffin.Read the full story by my colleague Pjotr Sauer here.It’s 6pm in Kyiv.

The warning is the first specific security alert the US embassy in Kyiv has issued in recent months and comes after a ban by the Ukrainian government on celebrations in the capital to mark Wednesday’s anniversary of independence from Soviet rule because of fears of attack.The mayor of Dnipro, Borys Filatov, has said  Russian rockets are falling on homes in the city and urged residents to stay under cover. Dnipro is located in south-central Ukraine and has been subjected to Russian long-range missile attacks during the war.The head of Ukraine’s security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said he expects Russia’s security services to stage a series of terrorist attacks in Russian cities, resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties. Danilov said that the murder on Saturday of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was the first in what he expects to be a number of attacks.Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina, the  daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist ideologues.

Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform summit.Russian forces are likely to have started to move barges to construct a floating bridge over the Dnipro River near the Antonivsky bridge, a British intelligence update said. The bridge in Kherson has been targeted repeatedly by Ukrainian forces with missile strikes as it is a key supply route for Russia in the south of the country. If Russia completes the improvised bridge, it will almost certainly increase the capacity of the crossing point compared with the ferry, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) believes.Russian tourists may be banned from entering Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland if the EU does not enact a bloc-wide ban, according to Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis.

The sanctioned individuals include high-ranking Russian government officials, their family members, and senior officials of currently sanctioned defence sector entities, a statement by the Canadian government said.A total of 33 cargo ships carrying around 719,549 tonnes of foodstuffs have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said. A further 18 vessels were loading or waiting for permission to leave Ukrainian ports, the ministry added. Three Black Sea ports were unblocked under the deal signed on 22 July by Moscow and Kyiv.Monthly payments to UK hosts of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them to provide housing for more than six months amid the cost of living crisis, the minister responsible has said. Councils have warned that homelessness could rise if refugees’ initial six-month placements with hosts end without alternative options in place.Good afternoon from London.

            "\tThe prime minister announced the new initiative as part of a package of new Canadian measures designed to support Ukraine and punish Russia for launching a war that has killed tens of thousands and whose impacts are being felt around the world.\r\n",
            "\tCanada is also imposing sanctions against 62 more people, including those the government described as several Russian regional governors and their families, as well as a Russian company whose products include anti-drone equipment.\r\n",

            "\tTrudeau revealed the package during a special meeting of leaders from countries that have been supporting Ukraine since Russian forces first crossed into the country on Feb. 24, launching Europe's largest conflict since the Second World War.\r\n",
            "\tNotionally intended to discuss Russia's illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014, the meeting also came as Ukrainians prepared to mark on Wednesday the anniversary of their country's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\r\n",

Will this conflict ever end?UKRANIAN REFUGEES IN THE US:Long-term survival is a big concern. Here's why.The U.S. is sending Ukraine a very expensive package for its independence day: $3 billion more in security aid.The latest assistance, to be announced Wednesday as Ukraine celebrates its separation from the Soviet Union in 1991, will focus less on the current war with Russia and more on equipping and training Ukrainian forces for the long term, U.S. officials told the Associated Press. The money will fund contracts for drones, weapons and other equipment that may not see the battlefield for a year or two, they said on condition of anonymity.The new package, unveiled as the war reaches the six-month mark, also serves as proof the United States remains committed to supporting Ukraine through thick and thin in the conflict, the officials said.The Ukrainian pro soccer league kicked off its new season Tuesday after a poignant ceremony paying tribute to those fighting in the war with Russia. The opening match at Kyiv’s empty, 65,000-seat Olympic Stadium featured two teams from the war-torn east, Shaktar Donetsk and Metalist 1925 of Kharkiv.Players entered the field with Ukrainian flags draped over their shoulders and observed a minute of silence while the names of cities where people had died in the war were displayed on a large screen. The first top-level soccer match played in the country since before Russia’s invasion in February ended in a 0-0 draw.Dennis Rodman has once again inserted himself into U.S. diplomatic relations, this time in an effort to free detained WNBA star Brittney Griner. The retired NBA great told NBC News he plans to travel to Russia to \"help that girl.\" But his contributions to the negotiations — if Russia even chooses to pay attention to him — will be minimal, or could even hurt Griner’s case, experts say. Rodman, the enigmatic three-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer, made his first foray into attempting peace with a U.S. adversary by bonding with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un over basketball. The current task would be negotiating with Russia for the release of Griner, who was convicted on drug charges and sentenced to nine years in prison earlier this month (she is currently appealing). State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters that Rodman would not be traveling on behalf of the U.S. government and \"anything other than negotiating further through the established channel is likely to complicate and hinder those release efforts.\" Read more here.— Chris Bumbaca, USA TODAYContributing: The Associated PressBy Brad Lendon and Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNNUpdated 9:00 AM ET, Tue August 23, 2022  (CNN)The US government is urging Americans in Ukraine to leave the country immediately, warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch attacks on civilian infrastructure and government facilities ahead of Ukrainian independence day.

Get features likeA day after the Indian Air Force (IAF) successfully targeted the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror training camp at Balakot on February 26, 2019, to avenge the Pulwama terror strike, the Pakistanis launched a counter with US F-16 fighters and Chinese JF-17 fighters south of Pir Panjal in Jammu and Kashmir. There is documentary evidence that the Pakistan Air Force relied only on F-16s to target unspecified targets in the Nowshera-Rajouri-Poonch sector across the LoC with JF-17 fighters not involved in the action at all. The Pakistani strike was intercepted by Indian fighters with Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman shooting down a much superior F-16 before crashing his vintage MiG-21 Bison in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). While the US F-16 fired air-to-air missiles at Indian fighters, the much-touted Sino-Pak developed JF-17 was just for show and did not see the air battle and remained hidden behind the American fighters. The JF-17 programme today is in the doldrums due to a lack of spare parts for the Russian-made Klimov RD 93 aircraft engine.Stung by multiple failures of JF-17 aircraft, primarily due to the serviceability of RD-93 engines, Pakistan had directly approached Russia for procuring the RD-93 engines, bypassing China. In the aftermath of multiple negotiations by Islamabad with Moscow, Russian engine company Kilmov has now indicated its willingness to supply RD-93 engines and its associated repair systems and maintenance facilities to JF-17 aircraft. However, in 2018, M/s Rosoboronexport, which is authorised to export defence equipment including RD- 93 engines and spares, was sanctioned by the US, thereby adversely affecting the sourcing of RD-93 engine spares by the PAF. The sanctions restrict Rosoboronexport from undertaking US dollar transactions, which the two governments and the concerned banks have now been attempting to sort out.Russia has been strengthening its defence ties with Pakistan by allowing it to procure the RD-93 engine directly from it as opposed to using China as an intermediary as was the case previously. However, international relations are in a state of flux and strategic equations are changing fast with Russia coming under pressure from the West and looking for support from others. It is apparent that Russia is moving close to China in the evolving geo­ political matrix which is sought to be exploited by Pakistan.Pakistan Air Force saddled with underperforming JF-17 aircraftThe JF-17 fighter jets, developed jointly by Pakistan and China, which was supposed to be a low-cost, lightweight, all-weather, multi-role fighter with a Chinese airframe, has now become a liability for Islamabad as it failed to keep up with the hype of being the best fighter aircraft in the world. Islamabad's experience with the JF-17 aircraft, particularly its Russian-made RD-93 engines, tells a completely different story besides casting serious doubt on the quality of these aircraft. The Pakistan military leadership had expected a fighter aircraft, something akin to the Russian Su-30 MKI or the French Mirage 2000 but the JF-17 aircraft fell well short of their high hopes as the aircraft performed poorly against the Indian Air Force's Mirage 2000 and Su-30s.Incidentally, since its induction into the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) in 2009, the JF-17 recorded a string of crashes, casting serious doubts on the fitness of the aircraft as the PAF found much to its chagrin, that the JF-17 aircraft is nowhere near the boastful claims made by China due to problems encountered in the performance of Russian made RD-93 engines, installed in the aircraft.Compounding the problem, the PAF has been encountering challenges in the serviceability of the aircraft due to a shortage of spares and engines. A large number of Russian RD 93 engines, installed in the JF-17 aircraft have developed cracks in guide vanes, exhaust nozzles and flame stabilisers, and the PAF has been struggling hard to replace these engines due to contractual obligations which forces Pakistan to procure the RD-93 engines from Russia only through China. Adding to the woes of the PAF, the China National Aero­ Technology Export & Import Corporation's (CATIC) tepid response in providing necessary spares and support for the RD-93 engines of PAF's JF-17 aircraft led to the grounding of more than half of the total number of these aircraft (137) held by the PAF.\n",

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later.Every week, I look at a map of Ukraine showing areas now controlled by Russia. There are roads and towns in the eastern Donbas region where I was able to freely walk and drive around two months ago that are now under Russian occupation.It’s the easiest way to confirm that Ukraine is losing the war.You may read regularly about some new shipment of weapons which will help Ukraine turn the tide in the east, or mount a major counter-offensive in the south. But it hasn’t happened yet.Sometimes it feels like the West is giving Ukraine just enough weaponry to hang on, rather than to win, even if it has made some interesting recent moves in striking at Russia’s naval bases in Crimea.It is true that Russian troops have made no significant territorial gains since they took the eastern city of Lysychansk on July 2, two weeks after I was in the city.But Russia did order a two-week operational pause to solidify its gains after taking Lysychansk, and it has now mounted a withering assault on the nearby city of Siversk.People sit inside a subway car parked in a station being used as a bomb shelter, as Russian attacks continue in Kharkiv, Ukraine.Credit:APSince President Vladimir Putin gave up his goal of taking the capital, Kyiv, and changed his strategy to capturing all of the Donbas and consolidating his gains in the south, Russia has been winning in what is a long, grinding conflict. That is the brutal truth of the matter.This probably hasn’t sunk in for many Australians. Because it was roughly at the time when Putin started shifting his strategy that interest in the war dropped off.After spending six weeks of this year in Ukraine, much of it in or near front-line positions in the east, my only prediction is this: the war has a long way to go yet. This is because both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are many more anniversaries away from achieving their goals.Putin’s goal is to take all of the Donbas, and then maybe mount another strike at Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv. While now controlling more than 20 per cent of Ukraine, he is many months away from achieving that.Ukrainian firefighters work in destroyed buildings after a rocket attack in Kharkiv on August 19.Credit:APAnd Zelensky’s objective is to push Russian soldiers out of all areas Ukraine controlled prior to Russia’s invasion on February 24. Zelensky’s goal, while inherently understandable, is even more unachievable than Putin’s as it currently stands.So we are left with an almost stalemate in which Putin advances centimetre by centimetre in the east and Ukraine tries to mount a counter-offensive in the south to take back the key port city of Kherson.So how will this end?Peace, if we can call it that, will probably look something like this: Ukraine gives up everything it didn’t control before February 24 this year, and Russia withdraws from everywhere else. That means recognising Russia’s annexation of Crimea and handing over the two breakaway regions of the Donbas to Moscow-backed separatists.But neither side is close to viewing this outcome as a win. Putin wouldn’t even consider it at the moment because he controls a lot more than that now, so he might as well keep going.And Zelensky doesn’t because he wouldn’t have ever countenanced it before February 24, and therefore the war would be all for nothing. Most importantly, Ukrainians wouldn’t accept that outcome; they would view it as a humiliation.It can’t be overstated how unfair this settlement would be for Ukrainians.Neither can it be overstated how dreadful it will be for them if the country continues to lose ground to Russia.But we will probably get to that outcome – or some rough version of it – after a lot more fighting and deaths.Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

Advertisement ................................Aug 22 (Reuters) - Russia's Federal Security Service accused Ukraine's secret services on Monday of killing Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist, in a car bomb attack near Moscow that President Vladimir Putin called \"evil\".Dugina, whose father Alexander Dugin is a prominent ideologue, was killed on Saturday when a bomb blew up the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving, Russian investigators said.  read more Ukraine, defending itself from what it says is an imperial-style war of conquest waged by Russia, denied involvement in the attack, with Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak calling the accusation \"propaganda\".Putin on Monday posthumously granted Dugina the Order of Courage, a prestigious state award, \"for courage and selflessness shown in the performance of professional duty\", the Kremlin said.Dugina, a regular commentator on state TV, strongly backed Russia's actions in Ukraine, which Moscow calls a \"special military operation\".Alexander Dugin, 60, has long advocated violence to achieve the unification of Russian-speaking and other territories.  read more In his first public statement on the bombing, he said Darya had been savagely killed before his own eyes by Ukraine.\"Our hearts are not simply thirsting for revenge or retribution,\" Dugin wrote. \"We only need our victory (against Ukraine). My daughter has sacrificed her young life on the altar of victory. So please win!\"Russia's FSB security service said the attack was carried out by a Ukrainian woman born in 1979, whom it named and whose picture and information appeared on Russian news websites.They linked her to Ukraine's security services and accused her of being a member of the Azov battalion, a unit of Ukraine's army that Russia has designated a terrorist group.In response, Azov said the woman had never been a member of the unit and accused Russia of concocting a lie.The FSB said the woman had arrived in Russia in July and spent a month preparing the attack. She had fled to Estonia afterwards, it said.Russian law enforcement agencies had placed the woman on the country's wanted list, TASS news agency reported, with Moscow seeking her extradition.Estonia's interior ministry and police and border guard service said in separate statements they could share information on individuals entering and leaving Estonia \"only in cases prescribed by law\", adding the FSB allegation did not meet that requirement.Flowers and candles are placed next to a portrait of media commentator Darya Dugina, who was killed in a car bomb attack, in Moscow, Russia August 22, 2022. REUTERS/Maxim ShemetovPutin paid tribute to Dugina as a patriot, calling her murder \"evil and cruel\", while Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the Kremlin-backed RT media organisation, suggested agents could track the woman down.\"Estonia, of course will not hand them over,\" Simonyan wrote on Telegram.A memorial service for Dugina will be held on Tuesday at Moscow's TV centre, her father said.On Monday, residents of Moscow laid flowers and lit candles at a makeshift memorial.\"She was a unique person, and this loss is absolutely irreplaceable,\" said Sergei Sidorov.Some Russian opposition figures were sceptical about the speed at which the FSB appeared to have solved the case and suggested alternative versions.Ilya Ponomaryov, a former lawmaker turned Ukraine-based Kremlin critic, said a previously unknown group of Russian militants called the National Republican Army was responsible.His assertion and the group's existence could not be independently verified by Reuters.Russia's Investigative Committee did not respond to a request for comment.Ponomaryov was the only member of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, to vote against the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and later left Russia.Ponomaryov, who runs an online TV station designed to challenge the Kremlin's narrative of the war, read out a manifesto he said the group had sent him.It said the group was committed to overthrowing Putin and building a new Russia. Such statements are illegal inside Russia and those who make them face long jail terms.His assertion adds to a list of possible theories about who killed Dugina.Some people believe her father was the target.Ukraine's Podolyak said he believed the killing was the result of a struggle between Russia's intelligence services.Some Russian opposition activists have speculated the murder may have been orchestrated by forces inside Russia keen to discourage ultra-nationalists like Dugin from criticising the Kremlin for being, in their eyes, too soft on Ukraine.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed on Tuesday to restore Ukrainian rule over Russia-annexed Crimea, a move that he said would help re-establish \"world law and order\".Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

              "'This live blog has now closed, please visit here for our latest coverageAn adviser to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack on the country’s independence day tomorrow.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday.Rodnyansky said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}People are reacting to the news. They are trying to ensure they have contingency plans, they don’t want to spend too much time near the centre near the buildings of our government.He added:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}There is a risk Russia will try to strike exactly at that time to compensate for their inability to have any success on the battlefield, to have any success in subduing Ukraine and basically all the failures they have run up over the last six months.Rodnyansky’s comments came after the US warned Russia may “step up” efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days.Ukraine’s defence ministry has advised Ukrainians to be especially careful on independence day, citing the threat of missile attacks and “provocations” from Russia.Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email.It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand:The US is expected to announce an additional military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), according to reports. The new package will be announced on Wednesday, the day the war in Ukraine hits the six-month mark, US officials were cited as saying. It would be the largest such assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war.Many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack on the country’s independence day, according to an adviser to Ukraine’s president. Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday.The US has issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. The warning is the first specific security alert the US embassy in Kyiv has issued in recent months and comes after a ban by the Ukrainian government on celebrations in the capital to mark Wednesday’s anniversary of independence from Soviet rule because of fears of attack.The head of Ukraine’s security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said he expects Russia’s security services to stage a series of terrorist attacks in Russian cities, resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties. Danilov said that the murder on Saturday of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was the first in what he expects to be a number of attacks.Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed a “powerful response” in the event of a Russian attack on Kyiv on or around independence day on Wednesday. There was a daily threat of Russian attacks and Ukrainian intelligence was working with foreign intelligence, Zelenskiy said in a joint news conference with the visiting Polish president, Andrzej Duda.Ukraine’s president said the country will not agree to any proposal to freeze the current frontlines in its conflict with Russia in order to “calm” Moscow, which now controls about 22% of Ukraine including Crimea. Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv today, Zelenskiy urged the world not to show fatigue with the war, saying this would pose a big threat to the whole world.Zelenskiy also promised to bring “freedom to Ukraine and citizens in Crimea” and vowed that the Ukrainian flag will fly “where it’s supposed to be” in all occupied parts of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said Kyiv would restore Ukrainian rule over the Russia-annexed region. “It started in Crimea and it will end in Crimea,” he told an international conference on Crimea.Boris Johnson has urged world leaders not to allow Vladimir Putin to repeat the annexation of Crimea in other parts of Ukraine. Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform summit.Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina, the daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist ideologues. Dugina, daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was murdered on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside Moscow. Russia’s FSB security service has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of ordering her killing, which Kyiv denies.Russian tourists may be banned from entering Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland if the EU does not enact a bloc-wide ban, according to Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. Russians should not be allowed to enter the EU while their country “is undertaking genocide”, Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius. It comes after the US rebuffed Ukraine’s demand for a blanket visa ban on Russians.The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling”, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues.The war in Ukraine has pushed people to “a critical breaking point” with “devastating” knock-on effects that will only grow as the conflict drags on, the Red Cross has warned. Soaring inflation and shortages of essential products like fuel and food in Ukraine and neighbouring countries have left people struggling to afford basic supplies, with the situation becoming more desperate as the weather chills in the weeks ahead. Kyiv has accused Moscow of having organised illegal mass adoptions of Ukrainian children after transferring them from occupied territories to Russia. “More than 1,000 children from Mariupol,” were “illegally transferred to outsiders in Tyumen, Irkutsk, Kemerovo and Altai Krai” in Siberia, a statement by Ukraine’s foreign ministry read.The UN has said it is “very concerned” about plans by Russian-backed authorities to hold trials for captured Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol. Pro-Russian officials appear to be installing metal cages in a hall in Mariupol as part of plans to establish what they were calling an “international tribunal”, a UN rights office spokesperson said, adding that such a process could itself amount to a war crime.That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thanks for reading. Here’s some more detail on the US military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn, which would be the single largest assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war.The package will use funds from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, appropriated by the US congress, to allow the Biden administration to procure weapons from industry rather than taking weapons from existing US weapons stocks, Reuters reports.The new weapons do not appear to include types of arms that had not been provided previously to the Ukrainian military, according to a US official.The amount and mix of weapons could change before the formal announcement, expected to take place tomorrow, the official added.Kyiv has accused Moscow of having organised illegal mass adoptions of Ukrainian children after transferring them from occupied territories to Russia.Since the beginning of the war, Kyiv has been accusing Moscow of “deporting” Ukrainians, saying Ukrainians from occupied territories have been forced to go to Russia rather than other regions of Ukraine.Ukraine’s foreign ministry said in a statement:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The Russian Federation continues to abduct children from the territory of Ukraine and arrange their illegal adoption by Russian citizens.“More than 1,000 children from Mariupol,” a southern Ukrainian city occupied by Russian troops, “were illegally transferred to outsiders in Tyumen, Irkutsk, Kemerovo and Altai Krai” in Siberia, the statement read.Read the full story here.The US is expected to announce an additional military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), according to reports.Associated Press cites US officials as saying that the new package will be announced on Wednesday, the day the war in Ukraine hits the six-month mark.The $3bn weapons assistance package would be the largest such assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war.The money will be used to train and equip Ukrainian forces to fight for years to come, as well as fund contracts for drones, weapons and other equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two, the sources said.Unlike most previous aid packages, the new funding will be aimed at helping Ukraine secure its future defence needs, according to officials familiar with the matter. Earlier packages focused on Ukraine’s more immediate needs for weapons and ammunition. The new package is intended to reassure Ukrainian officials that the US is committed to maintaining its support, regardless of the day-to-day back and forth of the conflict, the officials said.The war in Ukraine has pushed people to “a critical breaking point” with “devastating” knock-on effects that will only grow as the conflict drags on, the Red Cross has warned.The organisation said that “even if the conflict were to end tomorrow, it will take years to repair the damage to cities and homes and the impact on families”, AFP reports.Soaring inflation and shortages of essential products like fuel and food in Ukraine and neighbouring countries have left people struggling to afford basic supplies, with the situation becoming more desperate as the weather chills in the weeks ahead.Maksym Dotsenko, head of the Ukrainian Red Cross, said in a virtual press briefing:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}It will be the hardest winter. The war, now six months old, has stretched the entire humanitarian system and could lead to lasting impacts on the ability of organisations to tackle emergencies worldwide, the Red Cross added.Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine will not agree to any proposal to freeze the current frontlines in its conflict with Russia in order to “calm” Moscow, which now controls about 22% of Ukraine including Crimea.Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv today, the Ukrainian president urged the world not to show fatigue with the war, saying this would pose a big threat to the whole world.Zelenskiy told reporters:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}We’ll get back Crimea by any means we deem right, without consulting other countries.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said Vladimir Putin is betting the bloc’s response to his invasion of Ukraine will fracture as soaring prices hit European voters’ wallets.Russia’s president sees “the weariness of the Europeans and the reluctance of their citizens to bear the consequences of support for Ukraine”, Borrell said in an interview with AFP.“We will have to endure, spread the costs within the EU,” Borrell said. He added:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}We must give Ukraine support that goes beyond supplying weapons. Faced with someone who refuses to stop the war, we must be able to resist.Keeping the 27 member states united was a task to be carried out “day by day”, Borrell told the news agency. He also said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The member states are masters of their foreign policy. We must ensure that their interests reach a common point. We are always in compromise mode.Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said the country expects to receive up to $16bn (£13.5bn) of financial support from its international partners by the end of this year to help it deal with Russia’s invasion.In a statement, Shmyhal said Ukraine had managed to maintain its financial stability thanks to external assistance, which had already accounted for $14bn.More than 40% of the Ukrainian government’s spending so far this year – more than $11.5bn (£9.7bn) – had been allocated to military needs, he added.Hundreds of people have lined up in Moscow to pay tributes to Darya Dugina, the murdered daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist thinkers, hailing her as a martyr whose death must be avenged with victory in the war in Ukraine.Dugina, the daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was killed on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside the capital. Moscow has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of masterminding her killing, a claim Kyiv has denied.Her father, Dugin, 60, who for decades pushed for the creation of a new Russian state that would annex the territory of countries including Ukraine, told mourners his daughter “died for the people, died for Russia”.“The huge price we have to pay can only be justified by the highest achievement, our victory,” a visibly emotional Dugin said..css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}She lived for the sake of victory, and she died for the sake of victory. Our Russian victory, our truth, our Orthodox faith, our state.A large black and white portrait of Dugina, 30, who was reportedly close to her father and worked as a nationalist media commentator, hung on a wall behind her coffin.Read the full story by my colleague Pjotr Sauer here.It’s 6pm in Kyiv.

Dnipro is located in south-central Ukraine and has been subjected to Russian long-range missile attacks during the war.The head of Ukraine’s security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said he expects Russia’s security services to stage a series of terrorist attacks in Russian cities, resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties.

The bridge in Kherson has been targeted repeatedly by Ukrainian forces with missile strikes as it is a key supply route for Russia in the south of the country. If Russia completes the improvised bridge, it will almost certainly increase the capacity of the crossing point compared with the ferry, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) believes.Russian tourists may be banned from entering Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland if the EU does not enact a bloc-wide ban, according to Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis.

The sanctioned individuals include high-ranking Russian government officials, their family members, and senior officials of currently sanctioned defence sector entities, a statement by the Canadian government said.A total of 33 cargo ships carrying around 719,549 tonnes of foodstuffs have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said. A further 18 vessels were loading or waiting for permission to leave Ukrainian ports, the ministry added. Three Black Sea ports were unblocked under the deal signed on 22 July by Moscow and Kyiv.Monthly payments to UK hosts of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them to provide housing for more than six months amid the cost of living crisis, the minister responsible has said. Councils have warned that homelessness could rise if refugees’ initial six-month placements with hosts end without alternative options in place.Good afternoon from London.

That\\'s why Canada will create a dedicated team to help increase our capacity to monitor and detect Russian and other state-sponsored disinformation.”\\r\\n\\tThe prime minister did not provide further details in his short address to the meeting, whose attendees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and his office referred questions to Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly\\'s office.\\r\\n\\tJoly\\'s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\r\\n\\tThe government has previously enlisted different federal departments and agencies, including the Defence Department and Communications Security Establishment, to publicly call out what it considers Russian disinformation and propaganda.\\r\\n\\tScholz echoed Trudeau\\'s assertion that Russia\\'s invasion “was responsible for worsening food security, with grave implications for people worldwide,” even as the German leader reiterated his country\\'s continued support to Ukraine.\\r\\n\\tMeanwhile, a sense of dread deepened Tuesday in Ukraine because of warnings that Russia may try to spoil the country\\'s Independence Day holiday and mark the war\\'s six-month point with intensified attacks.\\r\\n\\tThe U.S. reinforced the worry with a security alert citing “information that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine\\'s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days.”\\r\\n\\tKyiv authorities have banned mass gatherings in the capital through Thursday for fear of missile attacks around Independence Day, and Zelenskyy over the weekend warned Russia “may try to do something particularly nasty, something particularly cruel.”\\r\\n\\tOn Tuesday, however, Zelenskyy stressed defiance rather than worry when he raised the national flag at a memorial one day ahead of Independence Day.\\r\\n\\t“The blue and yellow flag of Ukraine will again fly where it rightfully should be - in all temporarily occupied cities and villages of Ukraine,” he said, including the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.\\r\\n\\tHe added: “It is necessary to liberate Crimea from occupation. It will end where it had started.”\\r\\n\\tAt a separate event, Zelenskyy appeared to downplay the threats, indicating that at most, he expected increased intensity rather than new targets, and he added, “No one wants to die, but no one is afraid of Russia, and this is the most important signal.”\\r\\n\\t\\tSome additional details of what PM pledged for Ukraine:\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t-Among the individuals sanctioned are high-ranking Russian gov\\'t & defence officials\\r\\n\\t\\t-$ for Cda-Ukraine Police Development Project & Min of Defence\\r\\n\\t\\t-Disinfo team to help understand, monitor, detect state-sponsored disinfo\\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 23, 2022.Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly was challenged Thursday on her assertion the federal government making the decision to grant a two-year exemption to federal sanctions, allowing a Canadian company to return repaired turbines from a Russian-German natural gas pipeline, was done to \\'call Putin\\'s bluff.\\'Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair and RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki took turns Monday denying pressuring the RCMP, or interfering in the police investigation into the Nova Scotia mass shooting, saying that their approaches were appropriate and warranted, given the unprecedented nature of the situation.The Conservative Party leadership race is well underway as contenders hold rallies, duke it out in debates, and slowly release more details of their policy platforms.

Get features likeA day after the Indian Air Force (IAF) successfully targeted the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror training camp at Balakot on February 26, 2019, to avenge the Pulwama terror strike, the Pakistanis launched a counter with US F-16 fighters and Chinese JF-17 fighters south of Pir Panjal in Jammu and Kashmir. There is documentary evidence that the Pakistan Air Force relied only on F-16s to target unspecified targets in the Nowshera-Rajouri-Poonch sector across the LoC with JF-17 fighters not involved in the action at all. The Pakistani strike was intercepted by Indian fighters with Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman shooting down a much superior F-16 before crashing his vintage MiG-21 Bison in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). While the US F-16 fired air-to-air missiles at Indian fighters, the much-touted Sino-Pak developed JF-17 was just for show and did not see the air battle and remained hidden behind the American fighters. The JF-17 programme today is in the doldrums due to a lack of spare parts for the Russian-made Klimov RD 93 aircraft engine.Stung by multiple failures of JF-17 aircraft, primarily due to the serviceability of RD-93 engines, Pakistan had directly approached Russia for procuring the RD-93 engines, bypassing China. In the aftermath of multiple negotiations by Islamabad with Moscow, Russian engine company Kilmov has now indicated its willingness to supply RD-93 engines and its associated repair systems and maintenance facilities to JF-17 aircraft. However, in 2018, M/s Rosoboronexport, which is authorised to export defence equipment including RD- 93 engines and spares, was sanctioned by the US, thereby adversely affecting the sourcing of RD-93 engine spares by the PAF. The sanctions restrict Rosoboronexport from undertaking US dollar transactions, which the two governments and the concerned banks have now been attempting to sort out.Russia has been strengthening its defence ties with Pakistan by allowing it to procure the RD-93 engine directly from it as opposed to using China as an intermediary as was the case previously. However, international relations are in a state of flux and strategic equations are changing fast with Russia coming under pressure from the West and looking for support from others. It is apparent that Russia is moving close to China in the evolving geo\\xad political matrix which is sought to be exploited by Pakistan.Pakistan Air Force saddled with underperforming JF-17 aircraftThe JF-17 fighter jets, developed jointly by Pakistan and China, which was supposed to be a low-cost, lightweight, all-weather, multi-role fighter with a Chinese airframe, has now become a liability for Islamabad as it failed to keep up with the hype of being the best fighter aircraft in the world. Islamabad\\'s experience with the JF-17 aircraft, particularly its Russian-made RD-93 engines, tells a completely different story besides casting serious doubt on the quality of these aircraft. The Pakistan military leadership had expected a fighter aircraft, something akin to the Russian Su-30 MKI or the French Mirage 2000 but the JF-17 aircraft fell well short of their high hopes as the aircraft performed poorly against the Indian Air Force\\'s Mirage 2000 and Su-30s.Incidentally, since its induction into the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) in 2009, the JF-17 recorded a string of crashes, casting serious doubts on the fitness of the aircraft as the PAF found much to its chagrin, that the JF-17 aircraft is nowhere near the boastful claims made by China due to problems encountered in the performance of Russian made RD-93 engines, installed in the aircraft.Compounding the problem, the PAF has been encountering challenges in the serviceability of the aircraft due to a shortage of spares and engines. A large number of Russian RD 93 engines, installed in the JF-17 aircraft have developed cracks in guide vanes, exhaust nozzles and flame stabilisers, and the PAF has been struggling hard to replace these engines due to contractual obligations which forces Pakistan to procure the RD-93 engines from Russia only through China. Adding to the woes of the PAF, the China National Aero\\xad Technology Export & Import Corporation\\'s (CATIC) tepid response in providing necessary spares and support for the RD-93 engines of PAF\\'s JF-17 aircraft led to the grounding of more than half of the total number of these aircraft (137) held by the PAF.\\nAuthor of Indian Mujahideen: The Enemy Within (2011, Hachette) and Himalayan Face-off: Chinese Assertion and Indian Riposte (2014, Hachette).

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later.Every week, I look at a map of Ukraine showing areas now controlled by Russia. There are roads and towns in the eastern Donbas region where I was able to freely walk and drive around two months ago that are now under Russian occupation.It’s the easiest way to confirm that Ukraine is losing the war.You may read regularly about some new shipment of weapons which will help Ukraine turn the tide in the east, or mount a major counter-offensive in the south. But it hasn’t happened yet.Sometimes it feels like the West is giving Ukraine just enough weaponry to hang on, rather than to win, even if it has made some interesting recent moves in striking at Russia’s naval bases in Crimea.It is true that Russian troops have made no significant territorial gains since they took the eastern city of Lysychansk on July 2, two weeks after I was in the city.But Russia did order a two-week operational pause to solidify its gains after taking Lysychansk, and it has now mounted a withering assault on the nearby city of Siversk.People sit inside a subway car parked in a station being used as a bomb shelter, as Russian attacks continue in Kharkiv, Ukraine.Credit:APSince President Vladimir Putin gave up his goal of taking the capital, Kyiv, and changed his strategy to capturing all of the Donbas and consolidating his gains in the south, Russia has been winning in what is a long, grinding conflict. That is the brutal truth of the matter.This probably hasn’t sunk in for many Australians. Because it was roughly at the time when Putin started shifting his strategy that interest in the war dropped off.After spending six weeks of this year in Ukraine, much of it in or near front-line positions in the east, my only prediction is this: the war has a long way to go yet. This is because both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are many more anniversaries away from achieving their goals.Putin’s goal is to take all of the Donbas, and then maybe mount another strike at Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv. While now controlling more than 20 per cent of Ukraine, he is many months away from achieving that.Ukrainian firefighters work in destroyed buildings after a rocket attack in Kharkiv on August 19.Credit:APAnd Zelensky’s objective is to push Russian soldiers out of all areas Ukraine controlled prior to Russia’s invasion on February 24. Zelensky’s goal, while inherently understandable, is even more unachievable than Putin’s as it currently stands.So we are left with an almost stalemate in which Putin advances centimetre by centimetre in the east and Ukraine tries to mount a counter-offensive in the south to take back the key port city of Kherson.So how will this end?Peace, if we can call it that, will probably look something like this: Ukraine gives up everything it didn’t control before February 24 this year, and Russia withdraws from everywhere else. That means recognising Russia’s annexation of Crimea and handing over the two breakaway regions of the Donbas to Moscow-backed separatists.But neither side is close to viewing this outcome as a win. Putin wouldn’t even consider it at the moment because he controls a lot more than that now, so he might as well keep going.And Zelensky doesn’t because he wouldn’t have ever countenanced it before February 24, and therefore the war would be all for nothing. Most importantly, Ukrainians wouldn’t accept that outcome; they would view it as a humiliation.It can’t be overstated how unfair this settlement would be for Ukrainians.Neither can it be overstated how dreadful it will be for them if the country continues to lose ground to Russia.But we will probably get to that outcome – or some rough version of it – after a lot more fighting and deaths.Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

Advertisement ................................Aug 22 (Reuters) - Russia\\'s Federal Security Service accused Ukraine\\'s secret services on Monday of killing Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist, in a car bomb attack near Moscow that President Vladimir Putin called \"evil\".Dugina, whose father Alexander Dugin is a prominent ideologue, was killed on Saturday when a bomb blew up the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving, Russian investigators said.  read more Ukraine, defending itself from what it says is an imperial-style war of conquest waged by Russia, denied involvement in the attack, with Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak calling the accusation \"propaganda\".Putin on Monday posthumously granted Dugina the Order of Courage, a prestigious state award, \"for courage and selflessness shown in the performance of professional duty\", the Kremlin said.Dugina, a regular commentator on state TV, strongly backed Russia\\'s actions in Ukraine, which Moscow calls a \"special military operation\".Alexander Dugin, 60, has long advocated violence to achieve the unification of Russian-speaking and other territories.  read more In his first public statement on the bombing, he said Darya had been savagely killed before his own eyes by Ukraine.\"Our hearts are not simply thirsting for revenge or retribution,\" Dugin wrote. \"We only need our victory (against Ukraine). My daughter has sacrificed her young life on the altar of victory. So please win!\"Russia\\'s FSB security service said the attack was carried out by a Ukrainian woman born in 1979, whom it named and whose picture and information appeared on Russian news websites.They linked her to Ukraine\\'s security services and accused her of being a member of the Azov battalion, a unit of Ukraine\\'s army that Russia has designated a terrorist group.In response, Azov said the woman had never been a member of the unit and accused Russia of concocting a lie.The FSB said the woman had arrived in Russia in July and spent a month preparing the attack. She had fled to Estonia afterwards, it said.Russian law enforcement agencies had placed the woman on the country\\'s wanted list, TASS news agency reported, with Moscow seeking her extradition.Estonia\\'s interior ministry and police and border guard service said in separate statements they could share information on individuals entering and leaving Estonia \"only in cases prescribed by law\", adding the FSB allegation did not meet that requirement.Flowers and candles are placed next to a portrait of media commentator Darya Dugina, who was killed in a car bomb attack, in Moscow, Russia August 22, 2022. REUTERS/Maxim ShemetovPutin paid tribute to Dugina as a patriot, calling her murder \"evil and cruel\", while Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the Kremlin-backed RT media organisation, suggested agents could track the woman down.\"Estonia, of course will not hand them over,\" Simonyan wrote on Telegram.A memorial service for Dugina will be held on Tuesday at Moscow\\'s TV centre, her father said.On Monday, residents of Moscow laid flowers and lit candles at a makeshift memorial.\"She was a unique person, and this loss is absolutely irreplaceable,\" said Sergei Sidorov.Some Russian opposition figures were sceptical about the speed at which the FSB appeared to have solved the case and suggested alternative versions.Ilya Ponomaryov, a former lawmaker turned Ukraine-based Kremlin critic, said a previously unknown group of Russian militants called the National Republican Army was responsible.His assertion and the group\\'s existence could not be independently verified by Reuters.Russia\\'s Investigative Committee did not respond to a request for comment.Ponomaryov was the only member of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, to vote against the annexation of Ukraine\\'s Crimea region in 2014 and later left Russia.Ponomaryov, who runs an online TV station designed to challenge the Kremlin\\'s narrative of the war, read out a manifesto he said the group had sent him.It said the group was committed to overthrowing Putin and building a new Russia. Such statements are illegal inside Russia and those who make them face long jail terms.His assertion adds to a list of possible theories about who killed Dugina.Some people believe her father was the target.Ukraine\\'s Podolyak said he believed the killing was the result of a struggle between Russia\\'s intelligence services.Some Russian opposition activists have speculated the murder may have been orchestrated by forces inside Russia keen to discourage ultra-nationalists like Dugin from criticising the Kremlin for being, in their eyes, too soft on Ukraine.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed on Tuesday to restore Ukrainian rule over Russia-annexed Crimea, a move that he said would help re-establish \"world law and order\".Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.
